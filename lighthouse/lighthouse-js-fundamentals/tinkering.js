    console.log("Variable `a` has higher value"); // if a>b is true
else 
    console.log("Variable `b` has higher value"); // if a>b is false

//In general cases (regular equality check), a true corresponds to number 1, whereas false represents a number 0. For example:

    if(1){
      console.log("This statement will always execute because conditional is set to 1 i.e., true");
  }
  
  if(0){
          console.log("This statement will NEVER execute because conditional is set to 0 i.e., false");
  }

// NULL, UNDEFINED, NaN
// [null] refers to the "value of nothing", while 
// [undefined] refers to the "absence of value", 
// [NaN] stands for "Not-A-Number" and it's often returned indicating an error with number operations.

// calculating the square root of a negative number will return NaN

// trying to divide a string by 5 will return NaN

// Undefined example

// EQUALITY
// So far, youâ€™ve seen how you can use == and != to compare numbers and strings for equality. However, if you use == and != in situations where the values that you're comparing have different data-types, it can lead to some interesting results. For example,

console.log("1" == 1)
// Returns: true

console.log(0 == false)
// Returns: true. The == operator is unable to differentiate 0 from false.

console.log(' ' == false)
// Returns: true. Both the operands on either side of the == operator are first converted to zero, before comparison.

// The above return 'true' due to 'type comparison' == (first converted to numbers, before comparison) 
// If we don't want to convert the operands, before comparison, we have to use a strict comparison ===

// IMPLICIT TYPE COERCION

console.log("Hello" % 10)

console.log("3" > 1) //true
console.log(3 != "3") //false
console.log(true >= 0) //true
console.log(1 !== false) //true
console.log("false" === 0) //false
console.log(3 === 3) //true

// "3" > 1 is true because 3 is greater than 1 (implicit type coercion)
// true >= 0 is true because 1 greater than or equal to 0 (implicit type coercion)
// 1 !== false is true because 1 does not equal false (strict equality)
// 3 === 3 is true because 3 equals 3 (strict equality)
